Most of tile pixmaps in this directory derive from the pixmaps distributed
with the old xmahjongg solitaire game.

The tiles were originally black and white, produced by Mark A. Holm,
subject to a "non-profit only" licence.

The coloured versions were produced by Eddie Kohler, and in so far as
they are different works (a debatable point, I think), are distributed 
under the Gnu General Public License Version 2 or later, which may be
found in the file GPL.

The files have been renamed, one pixel of border trimmed off, and a
change made to the 7 Circle.

Only the suit and honour tiles are covered by this; the flowers and
seasons are by J. C. Bradfield (based on a real tile set) and are
placed in the public domain.
