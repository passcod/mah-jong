      to complete could result in the chow claim being ignored - fixed this.
  Code: backslash escaping tidied up, and infinite loop bug removed.

      Nicolas Boullis for these).

      in the expected location.

  Server: implement scoring with Millington's rules on kongs.
      Warning: server is not perfectly backward compatible, as annexed and

      of the appropriate option setting. However, earlier clients using my
      code will not be worried by this.

    Added game options:
    Limits on score, and no-limit games.
    Seven Pair hands.
    Flowers/Seasons optional.
    Scores for own Flower etc. changeable.
    Dead Wall may be per Millington, per everybody else, or not used.

    Handle new game options, such as no flowers.
    Eliminated flickering problem when the wall is shown.
    Suggests donation after ten full games.
  Player: complete re-write of strategy engine. Now plays much more
      strongly in offensive play. Still has only rudimentary defence.
    New strategy control options, but still undocumented. Probably
      stable enough to document: next release, perhaps.
    Handles the new game options (though never tries to get seven pairs).
  Code: in addition to all the code required for new features, there
      has been a large amount of tidying up. Still not enough...

1.0.4  2001-04-05
  Bugfix etc:
  Server: bug in scoring: was only giving 2 pts for fishing a major
      pair (despite saying 4 in the messsage!).
  Graphical client: default to a smaller size on 800x600 displays.
    Add an icon to the Windows version.      

1.0.3  2001-02-25
  Bugfix release.
  Graphical client: the --dialogs-below option has been broken since
      the pre-release (and nobody's noticed). Now fixed.

1.0.2  2001-02-10
  Bugfix release.
  Server: error in handling kongs declared while declaring specials:
      it wasn't drawing a replacement tile for the player.
    Also failing to handle properly the (vanishingly unlikely)
      case of such a kong being robbed.
    In addition, the Heaven's/Earth's Blessing hands were being
      incorrectly detected, and would not be granted if a kong had
      been declared before start of play.
    Added a delay that may help with a Windows problem, when the
      client crashes at end of game.
    Added a --seed option for the random number generator.
  Graphical client: now copes correctly with robbing a kong declared
      before start of play.

1.0.1  2001-01-28
  Bugfix patch:
  Server: rare but fatal and annoying bug fixed: when a player makes
      a dangerous discard and has no choice but to do so, the server
      would abort. Fixed by making the appropriate macro in
      game.h return a bool; also made encode_cmsg more liberal
      about what it accepts, to prevent further such bugs.

1.0  2001-01-22
  First full release. Changes since the pre-release:
  Rules: the rules now match the rest of the world in that konging
      and declaring flowers is allowed only after drawing from the wall.
      The protocol version has been incremented to 1010 to mark this change.
      (The old rule will still apply if playing with old clients.)
    Robbing a closed kong to complete Thirteen Unique Wonders is now
      implemented.
    The default score for bouquets has been cut back to one double.
    One or two outright bugs fixed (handling of Thirteen Wonders failed).
  Server: several bugs fixed (in ptic, letting off cannons was buggy).
    --exit-on-disconnect option added.
    --no-special-scores option added.
    --randomseats option changed to --random-seats.
  Player: several bugs fixed, and many (not very successful) attempts
      to improve the tactics.
  Graphical client: many bug fixes.
    Added "About" window.
    Added "New Game..." entry to "Connect" menu, to start a game
      with a local server and clients.
    The scoring window is now popped up at the end of scoring, rather
      than the beginning.
    A message is displayed while waiting for a suspended game to restart.
  Code: lots of restructuring, not least to accommodate Windows.
    Stopped using imake, just use a GNU Makefile instead.

1.0beta-pre1 2000-12-07
  Pre-release of first public source release.
